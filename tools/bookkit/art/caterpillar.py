"""The Caterpillar: green head, red bow with a yellow tuft, yellow belly, spiked green back.

Drawn upright facing the viewer on a 230 x 270 canvas, feet on y = 258.
The tail trails along the ground to the right. In `stride` she walks to the right: her tail trailing behind her on
the left, her belly ahead, her face turned the way she goes, her little feet stepping.
