"""Registry of the characters: the one entry point for every place that draws them.

A character is a module in this package. To add one, write the module and list it in `MODULES`;
nothing else in the code base needs to know its name. The module must define:

    SIZE          (width, height) of its canvas in drawing units
    FEET_Y        y of the ground line on that canvas
    BUST_BOX      square view box cropped to head and shoulders (round portrait frames)
    CENTER_X      x of the body axis, used to stand the figure on a spot
    HEAD_TOP      y of the crown, used to float a badge over the head
    PEEK_Y        y below which the figure is hidden when it looks over an edge
    SCENE_SCALE   canvas scale relative to the professor's so the cast stands in proportion
    HAND          color of the fingers: those that close round a held thing, and those over a poster's edge
    TALK_POSE     the full-figure pose used when the character speaks
    QUOTE_POSES   four poses a quote card cycles through
    RECAP_POSE    the pose in which the character presents a summary
    POSES         mapping of pose name to whatever the module's rig needs
    draw(pose, mood, **options) -> Canvas

Optional:

    VIEW_BOX          a wider view box when gestures reach outside the canvas
    SPAN              {pose: (left, right)} the canvas x a pose's drawing spans when it reaches past the box
                      the stage gives every character (0.4 of its width each side of CENTER_X)
    PORTRAIT_OPTIONS  extra `draw` options for cropped views (the cat hides its tail)
    SEAT              "chair" or "desk": where the character sits in the study scene
    BALLOON_GRIP      {pose: (x, y)} where a balloon string ends, for characters that carry one
    MOUTH             (x, y) of the mouth, where speech comes from (a footer's `Strip.mouth`)
    HOLD_Y            y down to which the character is drawn behind a poster it holds (the checklist block)
    hand_point(pose, side) -> (x, y)   where a character without wrists holds things (the sparrow's wing tips)
    hands(pose, grips=()) -> {"left": HandFrame, "right": HandFrame}, with `draw(..., grips=(sides))` closing
                  those hands into fists: a character that has them can hold things (`draw(..., hold=...)`)

The localized display name, the role line and extra spellings come from `locale/<lang>.yml`.
