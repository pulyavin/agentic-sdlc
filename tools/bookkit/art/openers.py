"""Chapter openers: one full-page story picture per chapter.

An opener is not a generic scene with the cast lined up: it is a page-sized picture with a story, in the manner
of the printed original's spreads: every chapter picture tells an interesting story, one people would look
at for several minutes. Each story is a function that composes a `Stage`:
a backdrop, then objects and characters placed by hand, each with its box.

The page around the picture is HTML: the title (drawn by `bookkit/title.py`: heavy ink letters on paper plates, line by
line; its real size is reserved) at the
top left, the chapter tag at the bottom left, and the professor's bubble, whose place the story
chooses so that he stands right under its tail. Those areas are reserved: no object may reach into them, and
no two objects overlap unless they belong to one group (a cat sitting on a desk, a book in a shelf).
`tests/test_openers.py` checks both; in the build the boxes go into the SVG as invisible rects, so the
paginator's "nothing runs into a picture" check sees the title and the bubble against the real drawing.

Units: the page is 840 x 1188 (4 units to the millimetre).
