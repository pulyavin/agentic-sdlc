"""The railway: the world of chapter 11 (how development looks now: Agentic SDLC).

A country station on a summer day, seen from its near platform. In front, the platform's paving where the cast
stands, its stone coping and yellow line; lower down the near track on its ballast - sleepers, chairs, rails with
head and foot, fishplates at the joints; across it the far platform's low face, its paving, and the station
building along it: one continuous facade of ruby brick with dark ruby pilasters and arches, arched windows with
their frames and sills, panelled doors under fanlights, gas lamps on their brackets, the wall clock at 4:04, and
the platform canopy on cast-iron brackets with its fretted valance; the sky over the roof. Nothing stands free in
front of it but what a station is about. Trains stand and run on the near track at their true size, cut by the
frame's sides when they are longer than it, never by its top or foot; in a low strip, where a carriage cannot
stand whole, the station shows a thing that can - the handcar, a flat wagon. The chapter's colour is ruby. The
stations, one per section of the chapter, each with one big thing the cast works with:

1. small     a small task: the professor hands the agent a telegram form, the handcar waiting on the rails; then
             the agent pumps the handcar off down the line, the dust flying from its wheels;
2. roles     how the roles change: the caterpillar runs her model railway with its controller in her hand - the
             prototype; then the cat oils the real engine's coupling rods with his long-spouted oil can;
3. plan      a big task: the timetable board under its own little roof - the professor signs the sheet at its
             foot, then the agent chalks in a new run;
4. parallel  several tasks at once: the points - the track splits into three in the frame, the agent throws the
             big ground lever with its counterweight, a train waits on each road;
5. to-pr     from code to the pull request: the cat taps a wheel with the wheel tapper's hammer and the
             caterpillar listens; then the agent screws up the coupling between two buffer beams, the professor
             looking on;
6. to-prod   from merge to production: the semaphore's arm has dropped and the train pulls out in its steam; at the
             terminus the engine stands buffers to buffers at the buffer stop;
7. metrics   how to tell it got better: the platform clock on its bracket - the professor holds his pocket watch
             up to it, the train in exactly on time;
8. no-human  development without a human: the train glides past with nobody in its cab, the cast watching from
             the platform bench, the sparrow on its back;
9. check     checking where you are still needed: the emergency-stop box on its post, the sparrow diving at it,
             the cat's paw on its cover.

No words in the pictures but the finale's names of the stations.
