# (`book audit`: every warning of the build is an error there, as with `book build --strict`). It writes the PDF, the
# report and the contact sheets of the flagged pages to ../dist/ci/.
#
# CI runs this inside the image of tools/Dockerfile; tools/container.sh runs it there on any machine. Run from tools/.
# BASE (a git ref, e.g. origin/main) makes the audit check that book/ changed only together with its version.
# ADVISORY=1 (a contributor's pull request from a fork) reports the layout warnings without failing on them: the
# maintainer lays the pages out in the pull request's branch, guarded by the `layout` job and tools/layout_gate.py.
